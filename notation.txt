Sudoku string format:
The sudoku string, which represents any sudoku field, is in the following format. It can be understood by the SudokuSymbol-class and contains no commas or similar characters which would prevent multiple strings from being stored in a csv file. The '&' and '%' signs are interpreted as a new cell or new row respectively. After the '_', there can be additional numbers to allow notes, with each number having their own leading '_'. This separation is needed to ensure compatibility with numbers with multiple digits.
